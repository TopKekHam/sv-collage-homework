    <h1>Exercise 9</h1>
    
    <h2>Compiler</h2>
    <p>
        Compliler is a program that takes an input (source code of the program)
        and produces instractions for a machine to execute.
        <br>The machine can be some sort of processor (CPU/GPU), or a JIT program like .NET runtime that reads the intermediate
        <br>language byte code that the C#/F#/VBasic compilers produced and converts its to the native machine byte code for
        <br>the processor to execute.
    </p>
    <h2>Interpreter</h2>
    <p>
        Interpreter is a program that runs an input as a program
        <br>(like python) and does not produce an executable to run.
    </p>

    <h2>Extra</h2>
    <p>
        In past years the difference between compiler and interpreter getting smaller, because the interpreters starting to create
        <br>an machine code to run without creating an executable like V8.
        <br>Another example, JAI compiler can run the source code
        without compiling (JAI is parallel to C in a type of usage).
    </p>

    <h1>Exercise 10</h1>
    <h2>Math.sign(num : number) : number</h2>
    <p>
        This method returns 1 or -1 depends on the sign bit of the number.
        <br>If the number is 0 or -0 it returns it as is.
        <br>If param is Infinity or -Infinity works as well.
        <br>If param is NaN returns Nan.
        <br>If param is any data type that not a number returns NaN.
    </p>

    <h2>Math.abs(num : number) : number</h2>
    <p>
        This method returns absolute of a number, for exaple, if we pass -5 to the method we get 5 as a return value.
        <br>If param is Infinity or -Infinity works as well.
        <br>If param is NaN returns NaN.
        <br>If param is any data type that not a number returns NaN.
    </p>
